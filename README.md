Step 1: Select a Number Pattern Type
We will create a pyramid pattern.

Step 2: Develop a Program to Generate the Selected Pattern
Here is the Python program to generate the pyramid pattern.

Step 3: Use Loops to Control the Structure of the Pattern
Outer Loop: Runs from '1' to 'n', representing each row of the pyramid.
First Inner Loop: Prints leading spaces to center-align the numbers.
Second Inner Loop: Prints numbers in ascending order from '1' to the current row number.
Third Inner Loop: Prints numbers in descending order from the current row number back to '1'.

Step 4: Verify the Correctness of the Generated Pattern
To verify the correctness, we can run the code and check the output. 

You can adjust the value of 'n' to generate different sizes of the pyramid pattern. 
This code ensures that the pattern is printed correctly by aligning the numbers symmetrically
around the center.
